# World_Weather_Analysis
# Overview
We have been analyzing the ride sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib we need to create a multiline graph which would reflect total weekly
fares for each city type. We will see how the data differs in each city type and and how those differences effect the decsion making.
# Results
Our analysis is based on categorizing the data into city types which is Urban, Suburban, Rural. Based on this catergoriztion we further analyzed the data towards 
total ride, total drivers, total fare, average fare and average fare per driver, per city. We found that drivers in rural city types was very less as compared to
drivers suburban and urban cities. The total fare for the rural area is $4,327 but the average fare is $34.62 and average fare per ride is $55.49, which is much higher
as compared to suburban and urban city averages. Below is the data:
