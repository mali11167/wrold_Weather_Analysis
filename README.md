# World_Weather_Analysis
# Overview
We have been analyzing the ride sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib we need to create a multiline graph which would reflect total weekly
fares for each city type. We will see how the data differs in each city type and and how those differences effect the decsion making.
# Results
Our analysis is based on categorizing the data into city types which is Urban, Suburban, Rural. Based on this catergoriztion we further analyzed the data towards 
total ride, total drivers, total fare, average fare and average fare per driver, per city. We found that drivers in rural city types was very less as compared to
drivers suburban and urban cities. The total fare for the rural area is $4,327 but the average fare is $34.62 and average fare per ride is $55.49, which is much higher
as compared to suburban and urban city averages. Below is the data:

# Summary
We analyzed the data and found that the drivers in rural areas are very less as compared to suburban and urban areas which effects the fare per ride and average fare
per driver. Because of less drivers in the area the fare for the ride is very high which eventually effects people not wanting to take a ride as it would cost more 
money and also avoiding the wait time for the ride to arrive as less drivers are operating in the area and it would take them long time to get to the rider because of 
distance. My suggestion for the business would be to:
* Hire more drivers for the rural areas.
* Offer them got job package so they will be willing to take up the job and would create more job opportunities. 
* As with more drivers it will also control the cost per driver in terms of mileage and fuel as more accessible drivers in different areas would mean less travel time
  and less fuel cost.
* Advertise in the area so people are aware how cost effiecient it would be for them as compared to travelling on their own cars as in rural areas even the grocerry stores
  are far away. Advertise to promote that more drivers are available which means less wait time.
